    Target:

        Building on our initial experiment with Claude AI.
        https://claude.ai/chat/6ada1d8e-c18b-4749-90d8-3e75d5d22dee

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Things we have learned after our first experiment.

    1) Python broker client

        Rather than asking Claude to connect to http services,
        we should give it a Python client for the broker.

        We should be able to generate the broker client from the OpenAPI specification.

    2) Simplify the requested start time to a single interval.

    3) Experiment with generating different things from the OpenAPI specification.
        a) Just the Pydantic beans
        b) Just the Java beans
        c) Just the endpoints
        d) Just the client

    4) Add test properties to the Java prototype.
       Including a delay in responding.
